🃏 Memory Card Game

  📖 Project Description
  
  This project is a Memory Card Game where the player must find matching pairs of cards by flipping them two at a time.
  The goal of the game is to match all pairs using memory and concentration in the fewest possible moves.
  
  This project was developed to practice programming fundamentals, game logic, and user interaction.



  🎯 Objectives

  - Implement the core logic of a Memory / Matching Card game

  - Manage game states (flipped cards, matched pairs, score)

  - Improve problem-solving and algorithmic thinking

  - Provide a simple and interactive gameplay experience



  🎮 Gameplay Rules

  - All cards are placed face down at the start of the game.

  - The player flips two cards per turn.

  - If the cards match, they remain face up and the cards become green.
